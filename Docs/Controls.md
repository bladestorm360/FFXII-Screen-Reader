# FFXII:TZA Keyboard Controls & Mod-Reserved Keys

The game's default keyboard bindings (from the in-game Controls menu — this user's
config) cross-referenced against the screen-reader mod's reserved hotkeys, so future
features pick conflict-free keys and we swallow/rebind any collisions.

> **STATUS: COMPLETE** (2026-07-07). Full Controls list captured (top + middle + bottom).
> **None of the mod's nav keys (`\ [ ] ``) or `o`/`t` appear anywhere in the game's
> bindings** — they are all free. Remaining conflicts are only the Shift modifier and Esc
> (see Conflicts).

## Mod-reserved keys (all STANDALONE — no Shift)
| Key | Mod function | Conflict status |
|---|---|---|
| `o` | Describe / read focused tooltip | free |
| `t` | Re-read last spoken line | free |
| `\` | Nav: describe current (name + bearing + distance + obstacle) | free |
| `[` | Nav: previous object | free (read bug under fix, not a binding clash) |
| `]` | Nav: next object | free |
| `-` | Nav: previous category | free |
| `=` | Nav: next category | free |
| `` ` `` | Nav: rescan + area name | free |
| `;` | Nav: facing readout | free |
| `/` | Nav: turn-by-turn route to current selection | free |
| `'` | Nav: diagnostic dump | free |
| `F4` | Combat log open (planned) | free (F1–F3 are game speed; F4 unbound) |
| `Esc` | Combat log close (planned) | game Pause — handled by modal intercept |

## Conflicts & resolutions
1. **Left Shift = Toggle Walk/Run.** RESOLVED — the mod uses **no Shift modifier** at all;
   category switching moved to standalone `-` / `=`, facing to `;`, diagnostic to `'`.
2. **Esc = Pause Game** (not cancel/back, as an older note assumed). Combat-log close on
   Esc is still fine because the log's modal input intercept swallows Esc while open.
3. `[ ] \ `` (non-shift): **no conflict — confirmed against the full list.** (`[` failing
   in-game is a scan-code/read bug, not a binding clash — under diagnosis.)

## Note on input capture (important)
FFXII acquires the keyboard via **DirectInput (exclusive)**, which starves OS-level
keyboard hooks (WH_KEYBOARD_LL) and NVDA's own commands. The mod therefore reads its
hotkeys by hooking the game's **`IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState`** (via the dinput8
proxy) and inspecting the same 256-byte DIK buffer the game polls each frame — so mod
keys work regardless of exclusivity, and the game's behaviour is unchanged. NVDA's *own*
key commands remain blocked under the game's exclusive grab (separate issue); the mod
does not depend on them (its own hotkeys + Tolk speech are self-contained).
