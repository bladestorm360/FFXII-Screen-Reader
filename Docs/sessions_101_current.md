# FFXII-Screen-Reader — Session Log (Sessions 101–current)

Continues `sessions_051_100.md`, which is closed at **Session 100** (the adjacency march +
auto-walk build).

Entry format is mandatory: `## Session N — YYYY-MM-DD — [track] <title>`, where `N` is a single,
global, monotonically increasing integer shared by all parallel tracks. Never a date-only header,
never a letter sub-session. Before appending, grep this file for the highest `## Session N` AND
check `git log` for an unlogged session after it; the next session takes `N+1`. Split again after
Session 150 (`sessions_101_150.md` + `sessions_151_current.md`). Every entry carries a KEYWORDS
line for grep.

## Session 101 — 2026-07-31 — [navigation] The goal is a SURFACE: the route now ends where walking first touches the seam

KEYWORDS: surface goal seam poly set map jump transition endpoint portal entry point path_surface_goal
PathSurfaceGoal::Route surfaceTouch first pop pass=surface-goal 315 northern sluiceway replan frontier
suppressed no path 16.4m short vertex boundary S98 diagnosis S99 circularity InsetCorners kArrivalTol

**The one residual defect from the S100 breakthrough.** Map 315 routes and the tester has walked it
(`319c0bb`), but a mid-route replan from certain approach directions still failed: the route target
is `MapQuery::NearestPointOnSurface` — the nearest tagged seam **vertex** in XZ — and on a 27 m seam
that is the corner the walkable approach reaches LAST. The final leg then runs along the exit surface,
validation fails, `PathSearch::Run` returns `Plan::Frontier` 16.4 m short, the planner suppresses it
and speaks "No path", and the beacon stops until the player presses `\` again.

### What shipped

`src/navigation/path_surface_goal.{h,cpp}` — a route that ends where walking first TOUCHES the
transition surface:

- **The endpoint is the PORTAL the corridor crosses onto the surface**, not a distance to anything.
  `EdgeClearSpan` (falling back to `EdgePortal`) → midpoint → step `kStepIn = 0.5 m` toward the
  surface poly's centroid so the arrival poly is unambiguously the transition → `ClosestPointOnPoly`
  to clamp back onto the triangle and take Y from its own plane.
- **The corridor is rebuilt for that end poly** via the existing `PathCorridor::Build`, the same
  helper `BuildFrontier` uses and for the same reason: funnelling one poly's portal sequence toward a
  point on another is not a path the funnel can repair.
- **Validation is the ordinary one, not a lighter one.** `BestPolarity` → `InsetCorners` →
  `DropPassedWaypoints` → `PathValidate::CheckLegs(poly, budget, kArrivalTol)`, in that order, with
  the corner footprint tests, the adjacency march and the pinned-corner acceptance all included.
  Accepted **only** on `ok && !truncated && size >= 2`; anything else falls through to today's
  frontier. No partial acceptance, no relaxed tolerance, no repair-ladder shortcut.

`path_search.cpp` grew by ~15 lines (it is already 789 and over the 500-line cap, which is why the
work went in its own file): an `unordered_set` built once per `Run` from `seamPolys`; `surfaceTouch`
recorded on the **first pop of any member**, reset beside `came.clear()` so the touch and the parent
links can never come from different passes; and the consumer replacing the `(void)seamPolys;` line.

### Why this cannot change a route that works today — the property, not the promise

1. `seamPolys` is `nullptr` for every request that is not a walk-onto transition
   (`path_planner.cpp` only fills it when `seamGroup != 0`), so the set is empty, `surfaceTouch`
   stays `kNoPoly`, and the whole block is unreachable.
2. The block sits **below** the `if (best.reachedGoal && bestReport.ok && !truncated) return
   Plan::Route`, so a route that validates never reaches it.
3. Observing the set costs one hash probe per pop and changes no A\* decision.

Only two outcomes are reachable: a validated `Route` where there is a suppressed Frontier / "No path"
today, or the frontier path exactly as it runs today.

### The S99 rule, and why this is not S98 again

**A route may never be validated against a point derived from that same route's own progress.** S98
aimed at the seam member nearest the banked proven prefix's end; the prefix already ended on a seam
poly, so the aim point WAS the reference (`0.0m from ref` ×18) and the re-run validated the prefix it
came from. Here the endpoint is a portal between two mesh triangles — geometry that exists whether or
not this search ran — and the proof is a body walk, not a distance comparison. `pass=seam` remains
grep-dead; this pass logs **`pass=surface-goal`**.

### State

**BUILT, DEPLOYED, NOT PLAY-CONFIRMED.** Regression gate to check first in the next tester log, before
anything else: `pass=seam` absent; the working 315 route still `pass=mesh` with `inset=` non-zero,
`validate: … OK` and ~20/20 legs; and **no `surface-goal:` line on it** — a validated route must never
reach the new block. Then the fix itself: replan from mid-bank should log `surface-goal: … ACCEPTED`
and `plan=Route` where it logged `FRONTIER SUPPRESSED … 16.4m short`.

Done on the `nav/surface-goal` worktree so it can be reverted without touching Session 102's
event-bound transition work. `debug.md`'s Sluiceway section had its stale "STILL BLOCKED" title struck
and rows 11-14 added — the anatomy of what actually unblocked the map.

## Session 102 — 2026-07-31 — [exits] The binding is the CALLS, not the NAME: event-bound transitions

KEYWORDS: event transfer staircase dungeon yes no prompt third transition kind map 313 north spur
sluiceway group 1 unclaimed NO CONTROLLER CLAIMS THIS GROUP __MJ_CTRL name filter setmapjumpgroup
mapjump flags presentation bitfield FUN_00355350 FUN_00314440 FUN_003145e0 routineIndex viaController

**The report:** a staircase on the map after 315 transfers the party into a dungeon behind a yes/no
prompt, and the mod lists nothing for it. It was framed as a **third transition kind**, after S64's
TRANSITIONS (walk onto a `setmapidmj` surface) and DOORS (press Enter on a `+0x70` field-sign object).

**It is not a third kind, and the mod's own log had been saying so** (`FFXII-Screen-Reader-Latest.log`,
23:18:27 on map 313):

```
exits: controllers=1 surfaces=2 listed=1 | dropped: nogroup=0 notused=0 unreachable=0
surface g1: 2 polys at (32.0,17.0,-0.8) box x[30.0..34.0] z[-5.8..4.2]
                                       <== NO CONTROLLER CLAIMS THIS GROUP -- unreachable exit
surface g2: 22 polys at (182.7,9.3,56.1)          (the 315 exit -- listed, routed, walked)
```

An ordinary walk-onto map-jump surface, group 1, two polys, sitting at Y=17 while the rest of the map
is at Y≈9 — up a flight of stairs. **The seam sweep already finds it.** Only the destination was
missing, so the S64 drop rule ("destination unresolved ⇒ it leads nowhere") deleted it, and a
progress-critical dungeon entrance was invisible to a blind player. The diagnostic line naming the
defect had been printing on every scan and nothing consumed it.

### Root cause: one `continue`

`map_script.cpp` rejected every routine whose NAME did not parse as `__MJ_CTRL<NNN>` **before its code
span was ever read**. Map 313's routine table has 31 entries and exactly one controller (back to 315);
among the rest is a routine whose Shift-JIS name begins **イベント** ("event"). The S64 rule is about
the CALLS a routine makes — `setmapjumpgroup(K)` for WHERE, that same routine's `mapjump` literal for
WHERE TO. The name was how they were found, and it hardened into the rule.

Second, narrower filter: only `mapjump` with `flags == 0` was accepted. From the decompile,
`FUN_00355350` (the native) → `FUN_00314440(dest, entrance, flags, 1)` → `FUN_003145e0`, and in
`FUN_00314440` `flags & 1` picks the no-fade path while `(flags >> 1) & 1` feeds `FUN_002efa70`.
**`flags` is a presentation bitfield, not a transition kind** (conf 0.99).

### What shipped

- **Every routine's code span is scanned** for the `setmapjumpgroup` + `mapjump` pair.
- **Admission for a non-controller routine requires `setmapjumpgroup`.** A routine that arms no group
  claims no surface — that keeps out the Director's world-map teleport run and every story-move
  `mapjump`. Without it, every map would sprout phantom exits with nowhere to stand, which is the
  failure S83/S84 spent two sessions deleting.
- **Controllers keep their exact previous behaviour**, including the `flags == 0` test and the
  group-less record that downstream still counts as `nogroup`. Non-controllers are admitted on any
  flags except the world-map menu's `0x0A`.
- **The arrival pairing is protected.** `ResolveControllerArrivals` binds controller *i* to arrival
  *i* by POSITION, so event-bound entries are held in a second vector and appended only after it has
  run, with no arrival of their own. Appending them first would have shifted every existing exit onto
  the wrong doorway on every map in the game.
- `ExitDest` gains `routineIndex` / `viaController` / `routineName` / `jumpFlags`; `exit_scan.cpp`
  keys the cursor id on a disjoint band for event-bound exits (`-(2000 + routineIndex)`), because
  their `ctrlIndex` is -1 and two on one map would collide.

### State

**BUILT AND MERGED INTO `combat-system` alongside Session 101, NOT play-confirmed.** Both sessions
were developed on their own branches (`nav/surface-goal`, `nav/event-transfer`) and merged as two
DISTINCT commits at the tester's instruction, so one build carries both while `git revert 83c77f0`
still backs out the pathfinding change on its own without losing this one. `nav/event-transfer`
stays as a live branch for further non-pathfinding exit work until pathing is thoroughly tested.

Falsifier, already written and already printing — on map 313:
`NO CONTROLLER CLAIMS THIS GROUP` for g1 must be **gone**, `listed=1` must become `listed=2` with a
real destination name, and the new entry must be routable at ~(32.0,17.0,-0.8). **On every other map
the listed count must not move** — a new exit appearing on a map that was already correct is a
regression, not a win. Taking the staircase should then produce a `CROSSING ORACLE … <== MATCH`.

If instead the log shows no routine claiming group 1, the binding is outside the map-control blob and
the EVENT script domain is next (`notes\dbg_symbols_evctrl.csv` carries its own `mapjump`,
`setmapjumpmode`, `setposparty_mapjump`, `lockmapjump`; confirm prompt is `FUN_002a6190`).
