// Read-only queries against the game's SQEX FIELD-COLLISION walkmap — the floor/wall
// mesh the field (and the AI NPCs) actually walk on. This is the walkability oracle for
// field navigation. Unlike Bullet (which the Nalbina prologue never builds), this mesh
// is loaded with every field map, so it is live wherever the player can walk.
//
// The collision ctx is a GLOBAL (DAT_0209a678, gated by DAT_0209a670) — read directly,
// no capture hook needed. The two query functions (FUN_003208c0 ground, FUN_00230b60
// segment) are reentrant and touch no shared writable state, so they are safe to call
// thousands of times per route. Every game call is SEH-guarded; a fault degrades to
// "no floor" / "clear" rather than crashing.
namespace MapQuery {

// True when the field-collision manager + ctx0 are present (the walkmap is loaded).
// Memory-only. This is the "world" liveness signal for IsFieldNavSafe.
bool HasWorld();

// Walkable-floor test at an arbitrary world (X,Z): true + ground height on success.
// The single best call for the A* grid's cell walkability. Gated on HasWorld().
bool GroundAt(float x, float z, float& outY);

// True if the straight segment from -> to is unobstructed by a WALKING wall (walk query
// class). Both endpoints are tested at `from.y` (equal-Y, so a slope-climbing segment can't
// clip a rising floor). Returns true (clear) when there is no world — callers gate on
// HasWorld() first.
bool SegmentClear(const FVec3& from, const FVec3& to);

// Raw segment test with an explicit query class + flags — returns the hit index (>=0
// BLOCKED, <0 CLEAR; <0 also when there is no world). Used by SegmentClear (walk class) and
// by the '-key self-test to log the walk (mask=4) vs camera (mask=0xffff) contrast.
